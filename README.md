Quantum-Computer-Simulator
==========================

Quantum Computer Simulator is a system, that allows a user to run quantum computing algorithms on an ordinary digital computer. Because quantum computers have complexity advantages over classical computers, any classical emulator will necessarily be less efficient than the quantum computer that it is emulating.
